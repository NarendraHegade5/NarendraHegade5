I am a Ph.D candidate in quantum information theory at International Center of Quantum Artificial Intelligence for Science and Technology (QuArtist), Shanghai University. I am advised by [Prof. Enrique Solano]. I received my masters's degree in applied physics from National Institute of technology, Silchar, India. My research focuses on breaking the abstraction barrier between quantum hardware and software, with the aim of realizing practical applications sooner than otherwise possible.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/){:target="\_blank"} and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/){:target="\_blank"}, like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
