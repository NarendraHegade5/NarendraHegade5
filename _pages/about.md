Hi there, my name is Narendra Hegade, and I am a research scientist at Kipu Quantum in Berlin, Germany. My work at Kipu focuses on breaking the abstraction barrier between quantum hardware and software to bring practical applications of quantum computing closer to reality.
I completed my Ph.D. in theoretical physics, specializing in quantum computation. During my Ph.D., I developed a novel paradigm called digitized-counterdiabatic quantum computing (DCQC) that implements adiabatic quantum algorithms enhanced by counterdiabatic protocols on a gate model quantum computer. This approach has the potential to speed up the adiabatic process and provide the flexibility to realize any arbitrary interactions, making it suitable for noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers.
Currently, my research interests are focused on developing quantum algorithms for quantum simulation, optimization problems, adiabatic quantum computation, and digital-analog quantum computing. I am particularly interested in addressing the challenging problem of what can be done on the near-term noisy quantum computers, as current digital quantum computers suffer from noise, analog quantum computers lack flexibility, and fault-tolerant quantum computers are currently metaphysical, with practical realization at least a decade away in the best case scenario.
To tackle this problem, I work on developing quantum algorithms by understanding the hardware, such as neutral atom quantum devices, trapped-ion quantum computers, and superconducting quantum processors. I am excited to continue exploring the potential of quantum computing and pushing the boundaries of what is possible in this exciting field.

<!-- I am a Ph.D candidate in quantum information theory at International Center of Quantum Artificial Intelligence for Science and Technology (QuArtist), Shanghai University. I am advised by [Prof. Enrique Solano](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0ZxS2k0AAAAJ&hl=nl). I received my masters's degree in applied physics from National Institute of technology, Silchar, India. My research focuses on breaking the abstraction barrier between quantum hardware and software, with the aim of realizing practical applications sooner than otherwise possible. -->
