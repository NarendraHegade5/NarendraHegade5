I am a Ph.D candidate in quantum information theory at International Center of Quantum Artificial Intelligence for Science and Technology (QuArtist), Shanghai University. I am advised by [Prof. Enrique Solano](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=0ZxS2k0AAAAJ&hl=nl). I received my masters's degree in applied physics from National Institute of technology, Silchar, India. My research focuses on breaking the abstraction barrier between quantum hardware and software, with the aim of realizing practical applications sooner than otherwise possible.
